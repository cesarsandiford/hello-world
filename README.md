# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow in the CSC154 class in Software Development.
I'm currently a CPCC student who is trying to learn a little bit of software development. So far I learned about all the necessary steps to do a project. From requirements to high level design and work all the way to other step that will get you to deployment. Looking forward to learn more.
